                    <p>Long ago, the world knew peace. Many races like bears and apes lived together in harmony, establishing their own cities in which to live.</p>
                    <p>In that time, the various races flourished. The trade links between them and the fact that there was peace allowed for freedom of movement and the spreading of ideas, letting everyone have their share of wealth.</p>
                    <p>However, it was not to last. As it always happens throughout history, one group decided that they did not have enough. They decided that although they already were getting their fair share, they could get more, much more.</p>
                    <p>The group in question were the apes. In secret, they began having regular meetings, arranging their strategy to eradicate all other races on the planet. If that was done, there would be nobody left to contest their rule, nobody left to take their materials and supplies. Their greed would finally be sated.</p>
                    <p>It took the apes some time, but eventually they struck. Throughout the planet, they launched their attacks simultaneously, aiming at the leadership of each race first in an attempt to cripple them before they had the chance to even respond to the apes’ attack.</p>
                    <p>The apes’ plan almost succeeded. In those first moments of combat, dozens of leaders fell, leaving the races without commanders in this pivotal time. </p>
                    <p>But the bears resisted the attack, even though their leaders also perished.</p>
                    <p>The bears managed to do this because they were aware that the attack was coming. Through their own cunning, they had discovered that something was going on with the apes, and had managed to deduce that they were planning an attack, even though they failed to comprehend its sheer scale.</p>
                    <p>The bears united as a community, and were able to decentralize their leadership to the point that although their actual leaders died, they were able to continue the fight.</p>
                    <p>The war between the apes and the bears lasted for years. In that time, the other races eventually perished, having lost their leaders and slowly backed into a corner by the apes.</p>
                    <p>But not the bears. Thanks to their ferocity, they continued to fight even when things seemed bleak, even when it looked like they had no chance of success.</p>
                    <p>Throughout that time, the world itself was wounded, as weapons of mass destruction were unleashed upon it.</p>
                    <p>In the end, the apes were defeated, and it was they that were eradicated to the last ape.</p>
                    <p>However, the bears also suffered, losing 12 twelve million and 400,000 souls in the great war.</p>
                    <p>When the war ended, there were only 3,700 bears in the whole world, the only living things in a planet once housing millions of people.</p>
                    <p>And yet, the bears had to persevere. They organized together, and they sent out expeditions in the ruins of the lost cities, looking for anything that might help them.</p>
                    <p>Most of those expeditions returned with food, electronics, water, medicine and other such necessities, as was required. However, soon enough a new tradition arose. There is said to be some special BearX’s among the population that was injected with a serum although no one is aware of what power those few yield.</p>
                    <p>When a bear joined an expedition, they had to search through the ruins for an accessory of some kind. A hat perhaps, or a pair of sunglasses. The exact accessory didn’t matter, what mattered was that the bear liked it and found it themselves. </p>
                    <p>The bears took to wearing those accessories as a badge of honor that catalogued their participation in expeditions. What was more, it also became a way for each bear to become more unique, to be easily recognizable and stand apart from the rest.</p>
                    <p>After not too much time, the bears had stabilized what remained of their society. They had scavenged enough food and technology to live comfortably for some time, and they could finally take a breath.</p>
                    <p>However, the bears knew that the good times would not last. Their numbers were limited, and if they tried to grow them by natural means the process would take far too long. By the time they had actually accomplished that goal, their supplies would have ran out.</p>
                    <p>And so, the bears decided that they needed to turn to technology. Although only a few thousand of them were left, some were accomplished scientists, and they set to work using whatever equipment and technological notes they could scavenge.</p>
                    <p>At first, the scientists tried to come up with low-scale solutions to the bears’ problems, like a way to extend the lifespan of their supplies or perhaps to create food out of thin air. However, no matter how hard the scientists tried, they could not perfect the formulas required for such tasks.</p>
                    <p>The scientists then turned to another field of technology entirely, one where the various races had only scratched the surface before the war against the apes. That field was genetic research.</p>
                    <p>Although it took years, the scientists were first able to grow bear limbs, like arms and legs. Then, using that knowledge, they expanded their abilities. </p>
                    <p>In the end, the first bear was created through only technological means, using DNA from most of the other bears. With this first specimen not only surviving but growing to adulthood, the scientists started making more artificial bears in a rapid speed.</p>
                    <p>In only a few weeks, this new species of bear – the MiniBearX, as the science project was called – had multiplied, with many bears already created. It is said that there are around 5000 in total, but the documentation on other pages will confirm otherwise. </p>
                    <p>With this newfound strength, the bears set about reclaiming their world, creating offspring, and preparing themselves for the fight against other species in the new world. This is BearX.</p>
